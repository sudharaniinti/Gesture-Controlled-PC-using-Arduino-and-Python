# Gesture-Controlled-PC-using-Arduino-and-Python
Gesture-controlled laptops and computers are all the rage these days, but they can be quite expensive. That's why I decided to build my own using Arduino and Python! Using two ultrasonic sensors to determine the position of my hand, I was able to control a media player (VLC) based on the position. The technique, known as Leap motion, allows me to control certain functions on my laptop simply by waving my hand in front of it.

I'm excited to share this project with you, as it demonstrates the power of combining hardware and software to create innovative solutions that are accessible to everyone. With just a few lines of code, you can customize the project to control your favorite application in your favorite way.
